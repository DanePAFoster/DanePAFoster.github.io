        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Dane Foster!</p><br>
        <p>
            I am a second year engineering management student at Gonzaga University. 
            If you don't know what that is, I dont blame you, it's a pretty new degree as far as they go.
            The curriculum mostly consists of a general education in engineering, accompanied by several management oriented classes.
            Its mostly designed to create employees who have a deeper understanding of management <em>in addition to,</em> a basic knowledge of engineering.

            I'm from in a (relatively) small town in Oregon called McMinnville. 
            For the most part that is where I went to school, with the exception of a few family trips to Ecuador and Mexico 
            where I went to school there for 4 months and 1 year, respectively. As a result of that, I consider myself fluent in converstaional Spanish 
            and proficient in academic Spanish. Click on the <em>Experience</em> button to the left if you want to know more about my experiences.

            Outside of school, I really enjoy climbing at <a href="https://wildwalls.com/">Wild Walls</a> or at <a href="https://www.blocyardgym.com/">Bloc Yard</a>.
            I also enjoy Longboarding around campus when its not so dang snowy. 
            When I'm not feeling like being active, I enjoy embroidery.
